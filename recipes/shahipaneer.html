    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons cooking oil</li>
        <li>1 large onion, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground coriander</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground turmeric</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon Kashmiri red chili powder</li>
        <li>4 tomatoes, pureed</li>
        <li>½ pound paneer, cubed</li>
        <li>¼ cup water</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon white sugar</li>
        <li>Salt to taste</li>
        <li>¼ cup cream</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook onion and garlic until onions are soft and golden brown, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle cumin, coriander, turmeric, and chili powder over onion and garlic. Continue cooking until fragrant, about 30 seconds.</li>
        <li>Add pureed tomatoes to the skillet. Cook until excess liquid evaporates and oil separates, 3 to 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add paneer, water, sugar, and salt. Stir gently so paneer does not break apart. Cook until paneer absorbs some liquid, about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir in cream and simmer another 5 minutes. Garnish with cilantro to serve.</li>
    </ul>
